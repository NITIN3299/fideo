<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


![Project Screen Shot](../main/src/image/ss.png)


Hey fellos, have you ever wondered that in this age of cloud, where you want to fetch anything at anytime from anywhere from your personal cloud storage, you can do it for free, as of now, without bothering to spend a single penny from your pocket. 

This project is aimed at:
* Encoding any file - pdf, image, zip archive, anything to a video
* Uploading that video to YouTube, as it provides us free umlimited cloud storage of videos
* Downloading that video anywhere and decoding back it into our original file

So in short, we are going to exploit the unlimited free cloud storage of videos provided by YouTube as our cloud backup of files. 

This is gonna be an short and interesting project with documentation at every step to help you in understanding what program does, and if you wish, you can change it as you want so it does computing what you wish, not what is decided by me.

### Built With

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Grab a python3 distribution and run the source code with the help of jupyter notebook. Both of these get set up if you install anaconda distribution on your system.

Or you can just have python3 installed on your machine and run `main.py` with proper options and arguments right from your terminal.

### Prerequisites

* bitstring
* Pillow
* glob3
* path.py
* ffmpeg-python

After installing anaconda, run in the `src` directory : 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in your terminal to install all the required dependencies and modules. Else they get installed automatically if you run the ipython notebook.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/shie-ld/fideo.git
```
2. Install required modules
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the ipython notebook in `src` folder 

Don't forget to put in the filename you want to encode in `encode_file` function in the last of the notebook. Check current directory and viola, you have encoded the file to video.

                                            **OR** 
 </p>
                                             
4. Hit `python3 main.py [options] <arguments>` with [proper options and arguments](#usage) and you are good to go.




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
### Using Jupyter Notebook:
Encode `file.zip` to `OUTFILE.mp4`: 
```sh
encode_file('file.zip')
```
Decode `OUTFILE.mp4` to `OUT.zip`:
```sh
decode_file('OUTFILE.mp4', 'OUT.zip')
```
which should come out to be an exact copy of `file.zip`. You can verify that by comparing the two files.

### Using Command Line:
```sh
OPTIONS
-e | --encode : Specify you want to encode a file

-d | --decode : Specify you want to decode a file

-i | --input : Specifying the input file. You can use absolute paths as well as relative paths. 
               It is a required argument.
               eg. -i /home/user/file.zip
               
-o | --output : Specifying the output file. You can use absolute paths as well as relative paths.
                Any existing file with same name will be deleted.
                At encoding time default is OUTFILE.mp4
                eg. -o /home/user/video.mp4
                
-f | --framerate : Specify the encoding and decoding framerate of video. Default is 24.
                   Must be integer. Encoding and Decoding should have the same framerate.
                
```

So practical usage will look like: 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

# encoding
python3 main.py -e -i infile.zip -f 15 -o video.mp4 

# decoding
python3 main.py -d -i video.mp4 -f 15 -o outfile.mp4 

```
